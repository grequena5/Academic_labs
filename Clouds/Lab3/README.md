# SparkSQL

In this notebook, I learned how to use the DataFrame API and SparkSQL to perform simple data analytics tasks.

## Goals
The main goals of this notebook are the following:
1. Understand the advantages and disadvantages of using DataFrame over RDD
2. Analyze the airline data with the DataFrame API and SparkSQL

## Steps

- First, in section 1, I went through a short introduction about the DataFrame API with a small example to see how can I use it and how it compares to the low-level RDD abstraction.
- In section 2, I delved into the details of the use case of this notebook including: providing the context, introducing the data
- In section 3, I performed data exploration and analysis
